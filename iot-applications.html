  <h1> Actvity 1</h1>
  <h2> what is an iot application ?</h2>
  <p> iot application is an collection of service where we can intwgrate
    data from various devices and sensors. it can work in real-time, and <br>
    informed decisions can also be made by it.
  </p>

  <h2> what are main features needed?</h2>
  <p> the main features of Iot App is they should work in real-time, person
    should be able to control it in real-time from any where. secondly, app<br>
    should be stable and secure, so that it could work properly and secure from
    users. moreover, intregration of devices in Iot should also be<br> smooth such that, user
    can easily integrate device in app.
  </p>

  <h2> what are some examples?</h2>

  <h1>Actvity 2</h1>
  <h2>what does smart mean?</h2>
  <p>smart refers to the device which is able to perform things intelligently,
    it is also logically efficient and folloews percipient approach.
  </p>
  <h2>what are the main features needed?</h2>
  <p>features needed in smart building are automated lightning system, smart taps, Automated doors, Accessibility for
    the disables<br> and Automated parking system</p>

  <h2> what are some Smart-building scenarios?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Carbon-monoxide Monitoring to maintain appropriate AQI.
